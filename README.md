# Black and White 2 Install

I've created a PowerShell script and guide to simplify the installation of Black & White 2. Follow the steps below to install.

1. Create a new folder and download the following files to that new folder:
    - Download the [Deviance Release ISO](https://d2.myabandonware.com/t/493c8f11-ac55-44ac-95a1-471e31f19579/Black-White-2_Win_EN-ES-DE-FR-IT-NL-PL_ISO-Version-Deviance-Release.iso) from MyAbandonware
    - Download the version 1.1, 1.2, and 1.42 patches from MyAbandonware
      - [V 1.1](https://d2.myabandonware.com/t/e27308d2-7b23-46f8-88dc-0b60334558c1/Black-White-2_Patch_Win_EN_Patch-v11.exe)
      - [V 1.2](https://d2.myabandonware.com/t/273d916a-a21f-4276-8afd-a6de96944bc6/Black-White-2_Patch_Win_EN_Patch-v12.exe)
      - [V 1.42 (AKA unofficial patch)](https://d2.myabandonware.com/t/e508ed13-77fb-4ff4-881b-c35978909115/Black-White-2_Patch_Win_EN_Patch-v142.zip)
          - Extract the 1.42 patch installer to the folder you previously created. "B&W2 Fan Patch v1.42 Installer.exe" should be in the same folder as "BW2Patch_v11.exe"
   - Download the [ProductKeys](https://d2.myabandonware.com/t/bd19e765-b5d1-4bcd-95c6-460c50f8ca59/Black-White-2_Misc_Win_EN_Serial-Keys.txt)
   - Download the [Install-BW2.ps1](https://github.com/N00bScriptr/Black-and-White-2-Install/blob/59a3cf00706c94e4685e94439acb022fd484a2bf/Install-BW2.ps1) script from this GitHub repository
 
4. Once all the install files are downloaded to the same folder, navigate to the folder containg the installation files
5. Right click on Install-BW2.ps1
6. Click Run with PowerShell
7. Once the folder selection window opens, select to the folder containg the installation files
8. The Black & White 2 Install window will open. Click continue until you get to a product key page
9. Insert one of the product keys from [Black-White-2 Misc Win EN Serial-Keys.txt](https://d2.myabandonware.com/t/bd19e765-b5d1-4bcd-95c6-460c50f8ca59/Black-White-2_Misc_Win_EN_Serial-Keys.txt) file that you downloaded earlier
10. Once product activation is successful, keep clicking continue on any windows or prompts that you see. The Install-BW2.ps1 script will automatically install the patches for you after the game is installed.
